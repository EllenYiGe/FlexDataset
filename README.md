## Experiments
![FlexDataset example](assets/img-exp.png)
> Examples of annotated data generated from FlexDataset with various MIMC (multi-instance and multi-category) configurations. Text prompts are created from generated scene using ControlCap (Zhao et al. 2024) for a fair comparison with T2D (text-to-data) methods (e.g., DatasetDM). Red: missed classes; Yellow boxes : blurred or overflowed classes.
